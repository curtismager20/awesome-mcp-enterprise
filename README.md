# Awesome MCP Enterprise [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)


> A curated list of awesome MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, platforms, and services for enterprises 🏢

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications give context to LLMs. This list is designed for all technical stakeholders exploring MCP solutions for building, finding, hosting, learning, securing, and using MCP servers and clients.

> **Scope:** This list covers **infrastructure, platforms, and services for building, hosting, running, and securing MCP servers**, not MCP servers themselves. If your product is an MCP server or an agent framework, it does not belong here. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — please read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

**How entries are vetted:** The MCP ecosystem is young and quality varies widely, so we maintain two lists. The **main list above** requires evidence of enterprise readiness — named customers, verifiable compliance (SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA), 6+ months GA, or documented production deployments (at least two of the four). Newer or early-stage projects live in **[EMERGING.md](EMERGING.md)** marked 🧪 while they mature.

**Workflow is issue-first:** open a [Listing Proposal issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/listing-proposal.yml) and wait for the `approved-for-pr` label before opening a PR. PRs opened without an approved proposal issue will be closed.
